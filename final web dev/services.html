                    <h2>IMPLANTS</h2>
                    <p>Dental implants are artificial tooth roots, typically made of titanium, that are surgically placed into the jawbone to support replacement teeth or bridges. They offer a durable and long-lasting solution for missing teeth, closely mimicking natural tooth function and appearance. Implants help preserve jaw structure, prevent bone loss, and restore proper chewing ability. We use advanced 3D scanning for precise placement.</p>

                    <h2>ROOT CANAL THERAPY (RCT)</h2>
                    <p>A root canal is a dental procedure used to treat infection or damage to the soft pulp inside a tooth. It involves removing the infected or damaged pulp, cleaning and disinfecting the area, and then filling and sealing the tooth to prevent future infection. Our single-sitting RCT ensures minimal discomfort and preserves your natural tooth structure.</p>

                    <h2>DENTAL CROWNS & BRIDGES</h2>
                    <p>Dental crowns are tooth-shaped caps placed over damaged or decayed teeth to restore their shape, size, strength, and appearance. They protect weak teeth and can be used as abutments for bridges to replace missing teeth. We offer a range of materials including Zirconia, Emax, PFM, and Metal crowns.</p>

                    <h2>SCALING & PROFESSIONAL CLEANING</h2>
                    <p>Scaling involves using specialized ultrasonic tools to remove hardened plaque and tartar (calculus) buildup from tooth surfaces and below the gum line. This routine procedure is essential for preventing gum disease (gingivitis/periodontitis), bad breath, and maintaining optimal oral hygiene.</p>
